/* Which way round the page is printed.
 *
 * The reader's operating system is still the default and still answers for most
 * members (see the theme block in styles.css). This module is only what it takes
 * for a member to say otherwise on one device, a screen read under office
 * lights and the same screen read at night are two different questions, which is
 * why the answer is **device-local and never synced**, like the exercise
 * preferences it sits beside in storage.js. A member signing in on a second
 * machine gets that machine's system answer, not the choice they made on this
 * one.
 *
 * The split is the one device.js makes: `normalizeTheme` and `resolveTheme` are
 * pure and unit-tested, and everything that has to ask the window is at the
 * bottom, kept to three lines.
 *
 * **The resolving happens here rather than in the stylesheet**, and that is what
 * keeps the dark palette written once. CSS cannot say "dark unless the member
 * asked for light" without repeating the whole block of token overrides under a
 * second selector, so `prefers-color-scheme` is read in one place, here, and
 * what lands on the root element is always the settled answer: `data-theme` of
 * "light" or "dark", never "system". The stylesheet reads that attribute and
 * nothing else. index.html stamps it before the first paint, so the page never
 * opens on the wrong ground and then turns over. */
