/* Samuel mode: getting ready for the 1 and 2 Samuel test.
 *
 * This is the one part of the app that is not about memorizing a verse. The
 * test on the thirtieth of September is over the *books*, who did what, where
 * it happened, and in which chapter, so what it drills is a question bank
 * (data/samuel.js) rather than the passage set, and what it tracks is which
 * questions a member keeps getting wrong.
 *
 * It deliberately does not touch the SRS. A verse's schedule is a claim about
 * how well somebody knows scripture they have committed, and a multiple-choice
 * answer about the census in 2 Samuel 24 is not evidence about that. So the two
 * models sit side by side and never write to each other: `srs.js` keeps the
 * verses, and the small record below keeps the quiz.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. The queue, the marking and the weakest-first
 * ordering are all `(input) => output`, which is what lets the whole mode be
 * tested in node without a browser anywhere near it. */
