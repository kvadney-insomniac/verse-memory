 * graduating class — that is stored alongside their progress (see storage.js /

 * option lists and the pure helpers; all functions are pure so they can be unit
 * tested in Node without a browser. */

 * as its default) rather than being written out here. Keep whatever list is
 * configured in canonical/ministry order, with an "Other" catch-all pinned last
 * (not alphabetized) for members whose group isn't listed.
 *
 * A group name is stored in the member's profile verbatim and read back by the
 * leaderboard's grouping, so renaming one leaves the members who chose the old
 * name filed under it — the same reason a category key never moves. Anything
 * that is not a non-empty string is dropped rather than offered as a blank row,
 * and a list configured as nothing at all leaves the picker with no suggestions,
 * which the form already handles: the field is free text with a picklist beside
 * it, not a closed menu. */
