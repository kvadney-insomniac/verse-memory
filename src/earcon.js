/* The two sounds that say whose turn it is.
 *
 * A hands-free session is a conversation, and a conversation nobody can see
 * needs the one thing a screen gives for free: knowing when it is your turn.
 * Speak mode had no such signal at all, the app stopped talking, the
 * microphone opened silently, and the member was left to guess. Guessing late
 * means the first words of the verse are said into a microphone that is already
 * listening but to a member who has not started, and guessing early means they
 * are said into one that is not open yet. Either way the recital is clipped and
 * the mark is wrong, which the member reads as the app being bad at listening.
 *
 * So: a rising two-tone when the microphone opens, and a single soft low tone
 * when it closes. Rising for "go", falling for "got it", the direction is the
 * message, and it is the same direction every telephone system has used for the
 * same two meanings for fifty years.
 *
 * They are synthesized rather than played from files for the reason the beat is
 * (see beat.js): nothing to ship, nothing to fetch, nothing to fail. This is a
 * separate module from beat.js because Speak mode has no beat, borrowing run
 * mode's audio engine to make two beeps would tie the two features together at
 * the one place they have nothing in common. */
