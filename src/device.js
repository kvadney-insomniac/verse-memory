/* What kind of machine the app is being read on.

 * Verse Mastery is not offered on a phone or a tablet: working a passage is
 * meant to be a sitting at a desk rather than another reason to pick the phone
 * up, so the app stands a gate in front of itself there (views/mobile-gate.js,
 * dispatched first in App.render, before even the splash, since a member who
 * is not getting in should not be made to watch the boot).
 *
 * The question this module answers is deliberately about the *device*, not the
 * window: a narrow browser window on a laptop is still a laptop, and the app's
 * own breakpoints (styles.css) are what serve it. So nothing here reads a
 * width. What it reads is what the browser says it is, a string and a touch
 * count, both handed in, which keeps the rule a pure function with the seam
 * (`detectMobile`) a single line beside it, as recognizer.js and firebase.js
 * are to voice.js and storage.js. */

/* Phones and small tablets name themselves in the user agent. "Mobi" is the
