/* Reading a stored progress map.
 *
 * A progress map is `{ [passageId]: record }` where a record is the shape
 * srs.js defines: `{ hits, status, last, step, stability }`. This module is the read
 * side, the pure questions the UI asks of that map ("how fresh is verse 12?",
 * "what should we review next?", "how long is the streak?"). The write side
 * (recording a review, toggling committed) stays with the component that owns
 * the state; persistence stays in storage.js.
 *
 * Records are normalised through srs.migrate() on every read so legacy records
 *, saved before stability existed, or before the interval ladder replaced it,
 * answer these questions correctly too.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of (map, now) and unit-tested in Node. */
