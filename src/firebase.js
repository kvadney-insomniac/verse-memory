/* Firebase authentication + cloud sync.
 *
 * Access is restricted to Google accounts in this deployment's Workspace
 * domains (see ALLOWED_DOMAINS below). Enforcement is twofold: (1) the client
 * rejects and signs out any account outside those domains, and (2) Firestore
 * security rules (deploy/firestore.rules) allow access only to verified
 * identities in them. Only the second is security — never rely on the client.
 *
 * Once a member is signed in, their progress syncs across devices:
 *   • Firestore stores one document per user at
 *     users/{uid} = { name, email, progress, log, profile }.
 *   • On sign-in we pull the remote doc and hand it back for merging.
 *   • Every local save is debounced and folded into the user's doc — the push
 *     reads before it writes, using the same merges as the pull, so a device
 *     holding an older copy of a verse cannot write it over a newer one.
 *   • The same push also writes standings/{uid}, a small summary of that record
 *     for the leaderboard to read instead of the record itself (see
 *     standings.summarize, and fetchRoster below for why).
 *
 * The Firebase modular SDK is imported from the gstatic CDN so the app keeps its
 * no-build, ES-module setup. If Firebase is unreachable/misconfigured the app
 * degrades to local-only (status "disabled").
 *
 * Setup checklist (Firebase console):
 *   1. Authentication → Sign-in method → enable "Google".
 *   2. Firestore Database → create, then deploy deploy/firestore.rules.
 *   3. Add the app's domain under Authentication → Settings → Authorized
 *      domains.
 *
 * Note: because sign-in can span more than one Workspace domain, Google's
 * single-domain `hd` hint is not used and the OAuth consent screen cannot be
 * locked to one Workspace. Domain membership is enforced by emailAllowed() and
 * the rules.
