/* The browser's own speech synthesis, wrapped.
 *
 * Written like recognizer.js: an optional overlay the app runs happily
 * without. `speechSupported()` coming back false just means Speak mode is not
 * offered on this browser. Kept thin on purpose, what is said, and when,
 * lives with the callers; this file only knows how to say it.
 *
 * `onDone` still fires whether the utterance finished, failed, or simply went
 * quiet without saying so, because a caller waiting to reopen the microphone
 * must never be left waiting. But it does **not** fire after `cancel()`, and
 * that exception is the whole reason this file was rewritten. Cancelling
 * mid-utterance reports `onerror` with `error: "interrupted"` rather than
 * `onend` (measured in Chromium on macOS, docs/research/tts.md §4.3), so a
 * speaker that treats every error as an ending calls back the very callback
 * that reopens the microphone and advances the queue, a Stop, or a walk off
 * the screen, silently moved the session on with nobody there. A cancel is the
 * caller taking control back, so every callback still in flight is made inert
 * by a generation token, exactly as beat.js's `stopSpeaking()` guards run mode.
 *
 * The rest of the file is docs/research/tts.md recommendation #1: a curated
 * voice, `rate = 0.9`, an explicit `lang`, sentence-sized chunks, and a real
 * pause between them. The pure parts, `pickVoice`, `chunkForSpeech`,
 * `speechMs`, take plain values and are unit-tested without a window, the way
 * device.js and theme.js keep their rule apart from their seam. */
