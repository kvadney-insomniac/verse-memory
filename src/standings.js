/* The board's own record of a member, and ranking groups instead of people.
 *
 * The leaderboard has always been able to *filter* by the three things a member
 * puts in their profile, ministry group, gender, graduating class. This is the
 * other half: the groups themselves ranked against each other, so a ministry can
 * see where it stands rather than only who inside it is doing well.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and takes the same roster rows viewmodel/leaderboard.js
 * has already assembled and filtered, `{ count, freshnessScore, streak, me }`
 * plus the profile fields, so grouping composes with filtering rather than
 * replacing it: rank the ministries within the class of 2027 and both questions
 * are answered at once.
 *
 * The measure is PER MEMBER, and that is the whole design. Ranking by a total
 * would rank by attendance: the largest ministry wins every week, the smallest
 * can never place, and the board stops telling anyone anything they can act on.
 * An average asks the only question a group can actually answer, how are we
 * doing, each of us, so a group of five holding their verses well outranks
 * forty who are not. */

/* The three things a member can be grouped by. `field` is the profile attribute;
 * `key` is what the segmented control and state carry. "people" is the absence
 * of grouping and deliberately lives in the same list, so the control is one
 * row of choices rather than a mode switch beside a mode switch. */

 * them in a group average would quietly re-admit them, and it would mean a

/* ── what the board reads ─────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/* The leaderboard used to be built by downloading every member's whole record,
 * their progress map for all 183 verses and their entire daily log, and then
 * throwing nearly all of it away to arrive at three numbers each. That is fine
 * for a dozen members and is not fine for a few hundred: it is the one read in
 * the app whose cost grows with the size of the group, and it grows in the
 * worst way, since every member pays it every time they open the board.
 *
 * So each member also keeps a summary of themselves, `standings/{uid}` in
 * Firestore (see firebase.js), and the board reads those instead. It is the
 * same three numbers, written by the one device that already has the record in
 * hand, rather than recomputed by every other device from the raw material.
 *
 * The one thing a summary cannot be is those three numbers. **Freshness
 * decays**: a score is a claim about a moment, and a stored one is wrong by the
 * time it is read. So the summary keeps the two figures the curve actually runs
 * on, when the verse was last reviewed and how stable it is, for the
 * committed verses only, and the reader runs the curve at the moment it asks.
 * That is a pair of numbers per committed verse instead of a record per verse
 * in the set, plus a log that grows for as long as the member uses the app.
 *
 * `fresh` holds those pairs flat, last, stability, last, stability, rather
 * than as a list of pairs, because Firestore will not store an array inside an
 * array. Which verse is which is deliberately not in there: the board asks how
 * many and how fresh, never which, so the ids would be a third of the payload
 * spent saying something nobody reads (and telling every member which verses
 * every other member has).
 *
 * The streak is the same problem in miniature and gets the same treatment: it
 * is stored with the day it was true of, and reads as nothing once that day is
 * older than yesterday. And the email is simply not here, the board never
 * needed it, and not sending it is one less thing every member holds about
 * every other. */
