/* Record the whole recitation, then transcribe it in one shot.
 *
 * Written like recognizer.js: an optional overlay the app runs happily
 * without. `recordingSupported()` coming back false, or `transcribeUrl` never
 * having been configured, just means Speak mode listens the way it always
 * has, through the browser's own streaming recognizer. Nothing here is a
 * replacement for that file; it is a second door into the same room, and
 * App.js is where the choice between them is made and visible.
 *
 * Why a second door at all. Streaming is the wrong *shape* for this app, and
 * the reasons are not tuning problems that a better threshold would fix
 * (docs/research/asr.md §1, §1.2, §1.3):
 *
 *   - Chrome desktop ends a `continuous` session of its own accord after about
 *     a minute, with no error and no ending a caller can tell from a real one.
 *     A sixty-second passage sits exactly on that line.
 *   - On Chrome for Android `continuous` is a documented no-op, MDN's compat
 *     data records "The property can be set, but has no effect". The car is a
 *     phone, so the mode's whole use case is the one where the flag does
 *     nothing.
 *   - Restarting a session that ended gets rate-limited, and a session that
 *     trips that limiter thereafter ends the instant it opens, forever.
 *     recognizer.js backs off around it, which is a good patch on a bad shape.
 *
 * None of those exist for a recorder. A MediaRecorder holds the microphone for
 * as long as it is asked to, on every platform, and the transcript arrives once
 * rather than in revisions. What is paid for it is a wait, a second or three
 * after the member stops, and Speak mode already pauses to say something after
 * every recital, so the wait lands inside a gap the design had already accepted.
 *
 * **The verse is never sent.** Not from here, and not from the Worker on the
 * other end. Every "bias the recogniser toward the expected text" mechanism,
 * Whisper's `initial_prompt` and `prefix`, Chrome's `phrases`, Deepgram's
 * keyterms, makes the engine more likely to return the expected words whether
 * or not the member said them, which is free accuracy for a dictation app and a
 * validity bug for a scoring one. See the head of worker/transcribe.js, where
 * the rule is enforced rather than merely stated.
 *
 * The seam is `{ start, stop, cancel }` and the split between the last two is
 * the same one speaker.js makes, for the same reason: `stop(onDone)` is the
 * turn ending, so it uploads and calls back, and `cancel()` is the caller
 * taking control back, so it does neither. A Stop press that still posted the
 * audio and still called back would reopen a microphone for a session nobody
 * is in.
 *
 * And it fails soft, everywhere. A refused microphone reports through
 * `onError`; every other failure, a dead endpoint, a timeout, a malformed
 * body, a blob over the cap, resolves `onDone("")`, which Speak mode already
 * knows how to answer (scoreRecital abstains, and the verse is read out
 * together). A hands-free loop waiting forever for a callback has ended without
 * telling anybody, at the wheel, which is the one place there is nobody free to
 * press a button.
 *
 * The pure parts, `pickMimeType`, `transcriptFrom`, `recordingRejection`, take
 * plain values and are unit-tested without a window, the way speaker.js keeps
 * `pickVoice` apart from its seam. */

/* Containers worth asking for, best first.

 * Opus is the whole reason to prefer the first two: it is the only codec here
 * tuned for speech at a bitrate a phone on cellular can spare, and a forty
 * second recitation comes out in tens of kilobytes rather than megabytes.
 * WebM/Opus is Chrome and Firefox; Ogg/Opus is Firefox's other spelling of it;
 * `audio/mp4` (AAC) is Safari, which supports neither of the first two and
 * costs a few times the bytes for the same speech. Whisper takes all of them.
 * Nothing supported is an honest answer and returns "", the caller falls back
