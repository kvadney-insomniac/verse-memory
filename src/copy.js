/* Every word the app says, in one place.
 *
 * The one stop shop for editing labels. Views and view-models import from here
 * rather than writing text inline, so re-wording a screen is a change to this
 * file and nothing else.
 *
 * Two shapes live here, and the difference is only whether the sentence has a
 * number in it:
 *
 *   - a plain string for text that never changes ("Back to the board");
 *   - a function for text that reads a value the app computed
 *     (`peekCost: (pct) => "Each peek costs " + pct + "%"`).
 *
 * A copy function is a formatter and nothing more: it takes values already
 * worked out by the caller and returns a string. It must not import from srs,
 * progress, or any other model — the numbers are computed where the rule lives
 * and passed in, so this file cannot become a second place the model is
 * described. (The member's commit threshold — profile.reviewSettings, read in
 * viewmodel/explainer.js — stays there; only the sentence around it lives here.)
 *
 * What deliberately is NOT here: the `name`/`short`/`desc` on MODES
 * (review.js), ACTIVITIES (exam.js), and the two difficulty tables (blanks.js).
 * Those sit beside `key` fields that are part of the persisted data model, and
 * splitting a row across two files to save a string would cost more than it
 * saves. STATUS_LABEL is the exception and is defined below, because it is
 * pure wording that four screens quote; progress.js re-exports it.
 *
 * Ordered to mirror src/views/ and src/viewmodel/ — one block per screen. */
