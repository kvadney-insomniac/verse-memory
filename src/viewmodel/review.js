/* What a review session should target before it starts.
 *
 * Review is the upkeep half of the app: it draws only on verses already
 * committed, and only those that have faded to the member's threshold. An empty
 * due queue therefore means they have genuinely caught up, and only then do the
 * manual controls come into play, which reach further up the same committed
 * shelf rather than into uncommitted verses. Learning those is a learn session's
 * job (see viewmodel/learn.js). */
