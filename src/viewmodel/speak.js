 * there is nothing due, but there are a hundred and eighty-seven passages it
 * could be reciting right now, and the one press that would show what Speak
 * mode is is greyed out behind a queue they cannot fill without first going
 * somewhere else. So a member with nothing committed starts on the whole set.

 * The condition is "has committed nothing", deliberately, and not "the due
 * queue is empty". A member who is caught up has an empty due queue too, and
