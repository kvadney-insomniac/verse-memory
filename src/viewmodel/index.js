/* Assembles the view-model, the single plain object every view reads.
 *
 * Views never touch component state: App hands this builder its state plus a
 * table of actions, and gets back one flat object of strings, numbers, and
 * callbacks. That keeps the templates declarative and makes the whole layer
 * testable without mounting anything (see test/views.test.mjs).
 *
 * Each per-view builder owns a disjoint set of keys; they are merged here. */
