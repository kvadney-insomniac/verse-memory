/* How the app works, in the member's terms.
 *
 * Two ideas carry the whole thing, what commits a verse, and freshness, and a
 * member meets one of the setup screens before their first sitting either way.
 * Both explanations are built here, once, so they cannot drift apart, and the
 * numbers are read off the model rather than written out, so retuning srs.js
 * retunes the explanation with it.
 *
 * The two are not both shown everywhere. Review-setup carries the freshness
 * explainer; learn-setup deliberately does not, because a member committing a
 * passage for the first time has no use for a percentage that decays. Which
 * screen renders which is the view's call (see views/explainer.js). */
