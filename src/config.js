   * This is only half the gate, and the half that is not security: the
   * authoritative check is the regex in deploy/firestore.rules. The two are
   * kept in step by `npm run rules` (tools/gen_rules.mjs), which writes that
   * file from this list, change the domains here, re-run it, and redeploy the
   * rules. A client admitting a domain the deployed rules refuse means every
   * read and write fails for those members, which the app cannot tell from
   * having no record at all, so they are asked to set up a profile on every
   * device and nothing ever syncs.
   *
   * Two values are deliberate rather than accidental. An **empty list admits
   * nobody**: a missing or malformed value is a misconfiguration, and a gate
   * that falls open on one is how a private record becomes public, a deployer
   * who has not yet decided who may sign in should have an app that lets no one
   * in, not one that lets everyone in. To open the app to **any** signed-in
   * Google account, say so out loud with the single entry ["*"]; that is a
   * decision somebody made, and it reads like one both here and in the
   * generated rules.
   *
   * Entries are matched against the whole domain after the final "@", so a
   * look-alike ("evilgpmail.org", "gpmail.org.evil.com") and a subdomain
   * ("sub.acts2.network") are both refused. See emailAllowed in firebase.js. */

   * A named list of somebody else's campuses is worse than no list at all to

   * for them, and the one honest answer left is "Other". The shapes below are
   * the ones most congregations have in some form, and the field is free text
   * with this list beside it as suggestions rather than a closed menu, so a
   * member whose group is not here simply types it.

   * A deployment with its own congregations names them here (see
   * config.example.js), in whatever order that group would read them, keeping
   * the "Other" catch-all pinned last rather than alphabetized. A group name
