/* Verse Mastery — root component.
 *
 * This is the only stateful module in the app. It owns the member's progress and
 * the running review session, exposes an `actions` table for the UI to call, and
 * dispatches to a view. It deliberately holds no rendering or derivation logic:
 *
 *   viewmodel/  turns (state, actions) into one plain object of strings and
 *               callbacks — all the derivation lives there
 *   views/      turn that object into markup — no state, no imports from here
 *   srs, blanks, grading, progress, exam, text — the pure domain, unit-tested
 *               in Node
 *
 * So a change to how something looks belongs in views/, a change to what is
 * shown in viewmodel/, and a change to how memory is modelled in srs.js. */
