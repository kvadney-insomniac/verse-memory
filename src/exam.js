/* Test mode, a graded exam over a chosen slice of the set.
 *
 * Self study (review.js) is untimed, ungraded, and one passage at a time: the
 * act of reviewing is the whole signal, so it can only ever raise a verse's
 * freshness. A test is the other half of the app. The member says how many
 * verses to be tested on, which of them count, and which activities to face;
 * answers every question with no feedback; and gets one score per verse, which
 * moves its freshness up *or down* (srs.nextStep / srs.testedLast).
 *
 * Everything here is pure. buildExam() takes a seed, so the same setup and seed
 * always produce the same paper, that is what makes the generator testable and
 * what stops a re-render from quietly rewriting the question under the member.
 * The running session (which question, what has been typed) belongs to the
 * component, exactly as a review session does.
 *
 * The module is "exam" in code and "Test" in the UI: `test` is taken by the
 * test suite, and a file called src/test.js next to test/ helps no one.
 *
 * The four activities:
 *   name-ref  a chunk of a verse → type where it is from (book + chapter)
 *   pick-ref  a chunk of a verse → choose the reference, or none of the above
 *   finish    a sentence stops partway → type the rest of it, and where it is from
 *   match     four verses and four references → pair them up
