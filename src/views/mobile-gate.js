/* The warning a member on a phone or a tablet meets before the app.
 *
 * It stands in front of everything, before the splash, before sign-in, and
 * it is an interstitial rather than a refusal: the app works on a phone, but
 * it was designed for a desk sitting, and there is a safety line worth saying
 * before every visit (copy.mobileGate). Continue is the one thing to press,
 * and pressing it lets the member through for this visit only, the
 * acknowledgement is never saved, so the warning is heard again next time.
 *
 * The two marks are drawn here rather than named as classes because they are
 * geometry, not motion, nothing on this screen moves except its arrival. They
 * are `aria-hidden`: the sentences under them already say it, and a reader
 * announcing "phone, monitor" would only say it again. */
