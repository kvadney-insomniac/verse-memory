/* Spaced-repetition scheduling, the "freshness" (forgetting curve) model.
 *
 * Each verse has a "freshness" = retrievability R = e^(−t/S), the Ebbinghaus
 * forgetting curve: t is days since the last review, S is the memory's stability
 * (in days). Reviewing raises S, so the curve decays more slowly afterward.
 *
 * What is *not* a free-running product is how much S rises. S is read off a
 * fixed ladder of intervals, a day, two days, three, … a week, a fortnight, a
 * month, and on out to a year, and a review moves the verse one rung along it.
 * That is deliberate, and it replaced a multiplicative (FSRS-shaped) model that
 * compounded about 3.9× a review: three good reviews put a verse out of sight
 * for a month and five put it away for a year and a half, so the app never
 * asked for the next-day review that is what actually makes a verse stick.
 *
 * The same hierarchy that decides how much a card is worth decides whether it
 * moves the verse along: an activity pays a ceiling of freshness, the attempt's
 * mark and every peek take from it, and that one figure is both the freshness
 * the verse is dated to (see reviewAward and backdatedLast) and the evidence
 * the ladder is moved on (see nextStep). All constants are tunable starting
 * points informed by the spaced-repetition literature, not fitted data.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of a progress record + the current time, so
 * it is trivial to unit-test and reason about independently of React state. */
