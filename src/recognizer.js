 * you type in, which is what it has always been, Firefox has no
 * SpeechRecognition, and nothing about that is worth working around here.
 *
 * A recognizer is `{ start, stop }`, driven through four callbacks:
 *
 *   onStatus(status)   "off" | "starting" | "listening"
 *   onText(text, settled, alternatives)
 *                      a phrase, whether the browser will still revise it (see
 *                      voice.js, an unsettled phrase replaces the last version
 *                      rather than being appended), and on a settled phrase the
 *                      engine's other readings of it (see MAX_ALTERNATIVES)
 *   onEndpoint()       the engine's own judgement that the speech it was
 *                      following has ended, see below
 *   onError(code)      a key from ERRORS
 *
 * It is never started by anything but the member: a microphone that switches
 * itself on is a bug, not a feature. */

 * The engine ranks its hypotheses by how confident it is that the words were

 * passage was said, and it knows the passage. So a caller with a verse in hand
 * can look past the top reading to the others and take whichever is closest to
 * the verse, which is N-best rescoring done in ten lines.
 *
 * It is worth being clear about why this is the safe kind of biasing, since the
 * alternatives (Chrome's `phrases`, Whisper's initial prompt) are not. Those
 * lean on the recogniser to hear what we expect, which in a *scoring* app is a
 * way of grading the member on the app's expectations rather than on what they
 * said. Re-ranking touches nothing: every reading offered here is one the
 * engine produced on its own, and choosing among them cannot invent a word
 * nobody spoke.
 *

 * disagree and no primary source settles it, so nothing depends on there being
