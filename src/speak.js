/* Speak mode: the hands-free recitation loop, as a pure module.
 *
 * The session is a cycle, PROMPT (speak the reference) → LISTEN (the member
 * recites) → GRADE → FEEDBACK (speak how it went) → NEXT (advance the queue,
 * wrapping), and this file models all of it that can be modelled without a
 * browser: what to say, how to mark what was heard, and where the queue goes
 * next. The microphone, the voice and the silence timer live in App.js, which
 * is why nothing here holds a timer or touches the DOM.
 *
 * Grading is `recital.js`, not `grading.js`, and the difference is the whole
 * reason this mode became usable. `gradeWritten()` is exact and positional,
 * which is right for something typed and wrong for something said: its cursor
 * only advances on a match, so three words the engine put in that the passage
 * did not want desynchronized it for the rest of the verse. A word-perfect
 * Proverbs 3:5-6 preceded by "trust in the...", a false start, the commonest
 * thing in real recitation, scored 14%. The member had recited it perfectly.
 *
 * `scoreRecital()` aligns instead, and charges almost nothing for a word nobody
 * asked for, so false starts, self-corrections and the engine's own noise are
 * free by construction while a genuinely forgotten clause still costs exactly
 * what it should. grading.js stays exactly as it was: nothing a member *types*
 * is forgiven, and the two graders never have to agree.
 *
 * Speak mode is practice only, nothing here (or in its callers) writes
 * progress or moves a verse along the ladder. Giving a clean spoken recital SRS
 * credit is follow-up work, and `strictScore` is the figure that gate should
 * read when it is built: it never counts the phonetic tier. */
