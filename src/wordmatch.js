/* When two words are the same word.
 *
 * This is the one loose comparison in the app, and it exists for one reason: a
 * speech recognizer hands back a *spelling*, not a sound. A member reciting
 * Galatians perfectly gets "sews" for `sow`; a member reciting Isaiah 9 gets
 * "naftali" for `Naphtali`. Neither of those is a recall error, and marking
 * them wrong fails the member who said the verse right — which is precisely the
 * failure reciting aloud was meant to save them from.
 *
 * The rule CLAUDE.md states about `voice.js` still holds, only its address has
 * changed: **nothing a member types is forgiven; what a microphone heard is.**
 * `grading.js` is exact and stays exact. This module is the loose half, and the
 * only things allowed to import it are the two with a microphone behind them —
 * `voice.js`, which fits heard words back onto the passage, and `recital.js`,
 * which scores a spoken recitation.
 *
 * Four tiers, strongest first, and each one is narrower than it looks:
 *
 *   exact      — the same word once `norm()` has taken case and punctuation off.
 *   homophone  — a curated, hand-audited pair. Not a recall error at all: the
 *                member produced the right sound and the engine picked a
 *                spelling. `no`/`know` is the argument for having the table,
 *                since both words are under MIN_FUZZY_LEN and no other tier can
 *                reach them.
 *   edit       — within one edit, ignoring a plural ending on either side, and
 *                never on a word short enough for one edit to be most of it.
 *                Moved here verbatim from `voice.js`, which imports it back.
 *   phonetic   — Double Metaphone key equality, gated hard (see below). This
 *                tier is deliberately the weakest and the most expensive, and
 *                the scorer's strict figure excludes it entirely.
 *
 * The tiers are OR'd; the phonetic tier's *internals* are an AND, and that
 * conjunction is the whole reason it is safe. Measured over this repo's 1,546
 * word vocabulary, crediting on key equality alone admits 194 pairs at two
 * edits — `love`/`life`, `holy`/`whole`, `blessed`/`pleased` — every one of
 * which is a word a member could genuinely have got wrong. Requiring key
 * equality *and* a two-edit gate *and* that the reference word be a proper noun
 * collapses that to a handful, because a name has no near neighbour in the
 * passage's semantic space for a false positive to land on: when the reference
 * word is `Naphtali` the member either has the name or does not. Edit distance
 * asks whether these are plausibly two transcriptions of one utterance; the
 * phonetic key asks whether they sound alike. Neither question alone is enough. */

 * introduces one this table does not name.
 *
 * The first eight are the pairs `docs/research/scoring.md` §2 measured over the
