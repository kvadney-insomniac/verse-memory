/* Playwright: the app driven end to end in a real browser.
 *
 * This suite is deliberately the complement of `npm test`, not a second copy of
 * it. The node:test suite renders every screen to static markup and asserts the
 * pure modules directly; what it cannot do is press a button. So everything
 * here is a behaviour that only exists once the app is running: state that
 * survives a reload, a card actually committed by typing a passage out, a run of
 * rows ticked by shift-click, the CSS the views only name (the count-up figures,
 * the two-sided card, the reduced-motion block), and the Firebase seam answering
 * over the wire.
 *
 * The app is served exactly as `npm run dev` serves it, no bundler, no build,
 * so what runs under test is the shipped tree. The three CDN scripts index.html
 * loads are the one substitution, fulfilled from the dev-only npm copies (see
 * e2e/helpers/app.mjs) so the suite neither needs the network nor pins itself to
 * unpkg's uptime. Set E2E_LIVE_CDN=1 to exercise the real CDN path. */

/* Seeds are built in node (e2e/helpers/seed.mjs) and read in the browser, and
 * both halves date by the local day, text.dayKey(). They have to agree on which
 * day that is, so the runner takes the same zone `use.timezoneId` gives the
 * page. Node re-reads TZ per call, so setting it here is enough. */
