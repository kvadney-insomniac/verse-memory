/* The shipped passage set: that it is well-formed, that it agrees with the
 * translation it claims to be in, and that it stays inside that translation's
 * licence where the translation has one.
 *
 * The licence half is the point of this file. Crossway's v3 terms cap how much
 * of their text may be stored and displayed — no more than 500 consecutive
 * verses, and no more than half of any one book — and the natural way to breach
 * that is not a bad line of code but a well-meant addition to
 * tools/new-passages.json. So the limits are asserted over what we actually
 * ship, where they can fail the build, rather than left in the README where
 * they can only be remembered.
 *
 * Those two limits are now **gated on the shipped translation being ESV**, and
 * that is a correction rather than a loosening: they were never a rule about
 * scripture, they are the terms Crossway attaches to their text, and applying
 * them to a public-domain set would be this repo inventing a restriction its
 * source does not carry. On an ESV build — which is what is committed today —
 * they register and run and fail the build exactly as they always have. */
