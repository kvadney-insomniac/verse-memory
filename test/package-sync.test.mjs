/* The scorer exists twice, and the duplication is deliberate rather than an
 * oversight anybody is going to clean up.
 *
 * `packages/recital-score/` is the publishable extraction of `src/recital.js`
 * and `src/wordmatch.js` — the alignment is general (language drills, reading
 * tutors, voice-agent evals all want it) and there is nothing scripture-specific
 * in the API. The obvious move once it is on npm would be for the app to depend
 * on it. **The app cannot.** It is a no-build, no-bundler static site: the
 * browser loads `src/*.js` as native ES modules straight off the origin, so
 * there is nothing in the pipeline that could resolve a bare `recital-score`
 * specifier at runtime — and adding one would mean adding a build step to an app
 * whose whole architecture is the absence of one (see CLAUDE.md, "No-build ES
 * modules + CDN globals").
 *
 * So two copies, and the copies must be **byte-identical**. That is achievable
 * because the package puts `recital.js`, `wordmatch.js` and a trimmed `text.js`
 * in a `src/` of its own, which makes every relative import in the two files
 * resolve unchanged — no import rewriting was needed, so there is nothing to
 * except from the comparison and this test is a plain equality.
 *
 * What it is guarding against is silent divergence: a cost retuned in one copy,
 * a homophone added to the other, and two graders that no longer agree about
 * what somebody said. */
