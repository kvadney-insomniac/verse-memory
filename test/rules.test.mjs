/* The drift alarm.
 *
 * deploy/firestore.rules is the authoritative half of the sign-in gate and it
 * cannot read src/config.js — it is uploaded to Firebase, not served with the
 * app — so the domains have to be written out in it. That is the arrangement
 * that lets the two halves come apart, and coming apart is silent: a client
 * admitting a domain the deployed rules refuse fails every read and write for
 * those members, and the app cannot tell a refused read from an empty record,
 * so they are asked to set up a profile on every device and nothing syncs.
 *
 * tools/gen_rules.mjs closes that by making the rules a product of the client's
 * own list. This is the check that the product on disk is still the current one:
 * change the domains without re-running the generator (or edit the generated
 * file by hand) and the suite says so here, rather than the members finding out.
 *
 * Everything is imported from the generator so nothing is described twice, and
 * nothing here writes — a test that regenerated the file would assert only that
 * it can call a function. */
