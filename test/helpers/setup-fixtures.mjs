/* Progress records at known freshnesses, shared by the two setup view-model
 * tests. Both screens are really testing the same division of the set, so they
 * describe verses the same way.
 *
 * Freshness is e^(−days/stability): a stability of 20 gives roughly 100% at 0
 * days, 95% at 1, 90% at 2, 61% at 10, 22% at 30, and 37% at 20. Each call site
 * quotes the figure it is relying on.
 *
 * Each record carries its rung of the interval ladder as well, so srs.migrate()
 * reads it as a current record and leaves the stability chosen here alone,
 * a record without a `step` is a legacy one, and migrating it would replace
 * these stabilities with the ladder's own. */
