/* The review-setup view-model: what a review session targets before it starts.

 * Review is the upkeep half of the app. It draws only on verses already

 * is a learn session's job (see test/learn-setup.test.mjs), and several of these
 * tests are really about that boundary.
 *
 * Pure function of (state, actions), so, like the other view-model tests,
 * nothing is mounted. A fixed `now` keeps freshness stable without touching the
 * global clock.
