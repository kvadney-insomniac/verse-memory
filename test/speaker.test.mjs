/* The speech-synthesis seam, against a stand-in for the browser.
 *
 * Two halves, split the way the module is. `pickVoice` and `chunkForSpeech` are
 * pure rules over plain values and are asserted directly, which is the point
 * of having lifted them out, since the interesting decision (which of 47 voices
 * a member hears) has nothing to do with a browser being present. The speaker
 * itself needs a window, and gets a fake one: a synthesiser that records what
 * it was asked to say without saying it, and timers that are recorded rather
 * than run, because the watchdog's own floor is eleven seconds and no test
 * should wait for it.
 *
 * The test this file exists for is "a cancelled line never calls back". That
 * was a live bug: cancelling fires `onerror` rather than `onend`, and Speak
 * mode's `onDone` is the callback that reopens the microphone and moves the
 * queue on, so a Stop used to advance the session it had just stopped. */
