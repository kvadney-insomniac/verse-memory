/* The transcription route, and the only server code this app has.
 *
 * Everything else about this deploy is static assets (see wrangler.jsonc): the
 * app is React and htm off a CDN with no bundler, and the one thing a browser
 * genuinely cannot do for itself is hold an API key. So `run_worker_first`
 * hands `/api/*` to this script and lets `env.ASSETS` serve the rest untouched,
 * which is both the cheapest routing and the smallest surface, a request that
 * is not `/api/transcribe` never reaches a line of provider code.
 *
 * ── THE RULE THAT IS NOT A STYLE PREFERENCE ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **The expected verse is never sent to the transcriber. Not ever, not in any
 * field, not "just for the proper nouns of this passage".**
 *
 * Every biasing mechanism a speech API offers, Whisper's `initial_prompt` and
 * `prefix`, Chrome's `phrases`, Deepgram's keyterms, makes the engine more
 * likely to return the text you gave it *whether or not the member actually
 * said it*. `prefix` is the extreme case: it literally forces the decoder to
 * begin with your text. For a dictation product that is free accuracy. For a
 * product that puts a score on a recitation it is a validity bug that eats the
 * whole feature, the app would be grading the member on its own expectations,
 * and a member who skipped verse 3 would be told they said it.
 * (docs/research/asr.md, "the one thing that matters most";
 * docs/research/audio-tools-2026.md, trap #1.)
 *
 * So: this route accepts **audio and nothing else**. There is no request field
 * a client can put text into, which is deliberate, a rule enforced by the
 * absence of a parameter cannot be forgotten by a caller in a hurry. The one
 * prompt that exists is `TRANSCRIBE_VOCAB`, a **server-side** environment
 * variable holding a fixed list of *words*, proper nouns and archaic forms the
 * corpus is full of and Whisper is not (`Melchizedek`, `Zerubbabel`, `thy`,
 * `steadfast`), with no ordering and no verse in it. That is biasing toward
 * the vocabulary rather than toward the word sequence, which fixes "the engine
 * cannot spell Habakkuk" without touching "did they say the whole psalm". If
 * you are ever tempted to pass a passage through it, the answer is no; keep two
 * transcripts or keep none.
 *
 * ── ABUSE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A Worker proxy with no controls in front of a paid API is not "hiding the
 * key", it is publishing the key at a URL you own with your billing attached
 * and the provider's own rate limiting removed from the path
 * (docs/research/audio-tools-2026.md §6). The controls below are the ones that
 * are free and belong in the request path. What is still missing, and is
 * follow-up work rather than an oversight:
 *
 *   - **Cloudflare Turnstile.** Gate the first request of a session, mint a
 *     short-lived signed token, check it here. Free, and usually invisible.
 *   - **Per-IP rate limiting.** A WAF rate-limiting rule on `/api/*`, or the
 *     Workers rate-limiting binding. A human cannot recite more than about two
 *     verses a minute, so the ceiling can be aggressive.
 *   - **A provider-side spend cap** on the Groq key, for the Groq path only.
 *
 * Until those exist, the caps here are what stand between a scanner and the
 * bill, which is why they are checked before anything is proxied and why a
 * malformed request gets a 4xx from this file rather than a forwarded one from
 * somebody else's. */
