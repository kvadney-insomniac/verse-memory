/* recital-score — the public surface.
 *
 * Everything below is re-exported from `src/`, which is a verbatim extraction
 * from the app this was written for (see README, and the LICENSE's attribution).
 * That is why the comments in those files talk about verses, members and a
 * microphone: they are the original reasoning, kept because it is the best
 * documentation the algorithm has, and kept *byte-identical* so that the app and
 * this package cannot quietly drift apart. Nothing about the API is specific to
 * that app — a "passage" is any text you know in advance and expect somebody to
 * produce from memory, and a "transcript" is whatever a recognizer heard.
 *
 * The tuning constants are exported rather than hidden because they are the
 * whole of the design: every one of them is a judgement somebody made about what
 * a mistake is worth, and a caller scoring something other than scripture recital
 * — a language drill, a reading tutor, a voice-agent eval — will want to argue
 * with at least one of them. Each is annotated with what moving it does.
