/* The app on a phone (the "mobile" project in playwright.config.mjs).
 *
 * A phone is no longer refused, it is warned. The app was designed for a desk
 * sitting and is at its best on a computer, so a phone gets one screen saying
 * so, with the Speak-mode safety warning on it and a single Continue button
 * through. What these check is that the warning is first, it arrives before
 * anything else, whatever the member has already done, that Continue really
 * does reach the app, and that the acknowledgement is deliberately not saved,
 * so the safety warning is shown again on the next visit.
 *
 * The rule itself (which user agents count) is asserted in test/device.test.mjs;
 * this is the half that needs a browser actually claiming to be a Pixel. */
