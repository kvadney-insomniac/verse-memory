 * fulfilled from the strings below instead, so the whole gate, sign in, a
 * refused domain, remote progress merged into local, signing out, runs against
 * the app's real code path with no Google account and no network.
 *
 * The stub is only ever as wide as src/firebase.js asks for. Its surface is
 * exactly the imports named there (initializeApp; getAuth, onAuthStateChanged,
 * signOut, GoogleAuthProvider, signInWithPopup; getFirestore, doc, getDoc,
 * getDocFromServer, setDoc, runTransaction, collection, getDocs), if that file starts using something else, the
 * stub fails loudly rather than pretending.
 *
 * The scenario is not baked into the modules: they read window.__E2E_FIREBASE__,
 * which the harness sets per test. Every document written lands in
 * window.__E2E_WRITES__, so a spec can assert that a session actually pushed. */
